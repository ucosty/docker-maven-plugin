= Maven Goals

This plugin supports the following goals which are explained in detail
in the next sections.

.Plugin Goals
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Goal | Description

|**<<{plugin}:build>>**

|**<<{plugin}:start>>** or **<<{plugin}:start,{plugin}:run>>**
|Create and start containers

|**<<{plugin}:stop>>**
|Stop and destroy containers

|**<<{plugin}:push>>**
|Push images to a registry

|**<<{plugin}:watch>>**
|Watch for doing rebuilds and restarts

|**<<{plugin}:remove>>**
|Remove images from local docker host

|**<<{plugin}:logs>>**
|Show container logs

|===

Note that all goals are orthogonal to each other. For example in order
to start a container for your application you typically have to build
its image before. `{plugin}:start` does *not* imply building the image
so you should use it then in combination with `{plugin}:build`.
